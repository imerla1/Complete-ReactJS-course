# primitive and reference types
summary:
- Javascript has two types of values: primitive values and reference values.
- You can add, change, or delete properties to a reference value, whereas you cannot do it with a primitive value.
- Copying a primitive value from one variable to another creates a separate value copy. It means that changing the value in one variable does not affect the other.
- Copying a reference from one variable to another creates a reference so that two variables refer to the same object. This means that changing the object via one variable reflects in another variable.

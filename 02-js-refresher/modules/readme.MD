# import and export (modules)

In React projects (and actually in all modern JavaScriptprojects), you split your code across multiple JavaScript files - so-called **modules**. You do this, to keep each file/module focused and manageable.

To still access functionality in another file, you need **export** (to make it available) and **import** (to get access) statements.

You got two diï¬€erent types of ***exports***:
- default (unnamed)
- namedexports
